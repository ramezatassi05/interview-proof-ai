1) Is this actually useful?
Yes — but only if you don’t overclaim “pass probability” and you package the output like a diagnostic, not “AI advice.”
What the market already proves
People pay significant money for interview confidence + specificity:
* Interviewing.io sells single mock interviews starting around $179–$225+ depending on context (their FAQ + third-party reviews).

* Big Interview sells subscription + $299 lifetime and positions it as “shave months off job search.”

* Exponent pushes subscription value (courses, peer mocks, questions) with pricing called out as $79 monthly / ~$12 monthly billed annually.

* Resume tools like Rezi successfully sell one-time lifetime options (e.g., $149) and also monthly plans.

So the willingness to pay exists. The gap is: none of these are “job-specific readiness diagnostics” as the primary product — most are practice platforms, coaching marketplaces, or resume optimizers.
What will make it actually valuable (and not “just a wrapper”)
Your MVP becomes “real” when the output is:
   * Auditable (why the score is what it is)

   * Comparable over time (score changes after edits/practice)

   * Mapped to a stable rubric/ontology (not vibes)

That’s exactly why domain vertical tools like Harvey win: they aren’t “a chat,” they’re trusted workflow + structure + integrations. Harvey explicitly focuses on defensibility + enterprise readiness and integrates into Microsoft tools lawyers already use.

2) Best approach to generate revenue (with $15 premium target)
Reality check on pricing
At $15, you’re competing with:
      * “AI copilot” subscriptions in the $14.99–$35/month range (Verve Copilot pricing page).

      * “Training platforms” at $39/month (Big Interview monthly).

      * “Lifetime” at $149–$299 (Rezi / Big Interview).

$15 is totally plausible — but the packaging matters more than the number.
The strongest proven monetization for your product
Because your product is per interview / per round, the cleanest monetization is:
Option A (recommended): Pay-per-report (credits)
         * Free: Score + top 3 risks (no export, no rerun, no delta tracking)

         * $15 “Full Report” (per interview round):

            * full ranked rejection risks (10–15 items)

            * role-specific question set

            * short study plan + time estimates

            * downloadable PDF (people love sharing/saving proof)

            * rerun once after edits (to show score delta)

This matches how people behave: job search is bursty, not continuous. Credits also stop “I’ll sub for 1 month then cancel.”
You can later add bundles:
               * $29 = 3 reports (3 rounds or 3 jobs)

               * $49 = unlimited reruns for 14 days (high urgency window)

Option B: Subscription (only if you add repetition-heavy features)
Subscription works when users return weekly (question bank, mock interviews, community, job tracker). That’s why Exponent/Big Interview can sustain subscriptions.
For your MVP (diagnostic + plan), credits is cleaner.
Option C: “Lifetime”
This works for resume builders because resumes are universal + repeat use (Rezi).
For InterviewProof, lifetime is risky early unless your feature set expands.
Net: Start with credits. Keep $15 as the “full diagnostic” price.

3) How to build a real vertical AI tool (RAG-based, Harvey-style) vs a GPT wrapper
First, an important clarification
A vertical AI tool is not defined by “using a vector database.”
 It is defined by having:
                  1. A domain model / ontology

                  2. Grounded retrieval from trusted, structured sources

                  3. Deterministic logic layered on top of LLM reasoning

                  4. Outputs that are auditable, repeatable, and workflow-specific

A vector database is a means, not the moat.
That said, for InterviewProof, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture does meaningfully increase defensibility, credibility, and output quality when done correctly.
________________


The correct mental model (simple but accurate)
In super simple terms, a real vertical AI tool works like this:
                     1. User provides inputs

                        * Resume (PDF or text)

                        * Job description

                        * Interview round type (technical, behavioral, case, finance)

                        * Optional company name

                           2. System retrieves high-quality, domain-specific context

                              * Role skill expectations

                              * Interview rubrics

                              * Question archetypes

                              * Evaluation criteria grounded in real data

                                 3. LLM performs expert reasoning using that retrieved context

                                    * Not guessing

                                    * Not generic

                                    * Not “best practices from the internet”

                                       4. A deterministic scoring engine produces the verdict

                                          * Readiness score

                                          * Ranked rejection risks

                                          * Evidence-backed explanations

                                             5. The output is explainable, repeatable, and comparable over time

This is how you avoid being a GPT wrapper.

What makes InterviewProof “vertical” in practice
The verticality does not come from scraping random websites.
It comes from what you retrieve and how you score.
1) Ground truth sources (what you retrieve)
For InterviewProof, retrieval should prioritize structured expectations, not opinionated advice.
A) Role & skill taxonomies (baseline truth)
                                                * Use public, structured datasets such as government occupational frameworks (e.g., skill/role taxonomies)

                                                * These provide canonical expectations for roles (skills, responsibilities, seniority signals)

                                                * This prevents hallucinated or arbitrary “requirements”

B) InterviewProof’s internal rubric library (your real moat)
 A curated, versioned set of evaluation rubrics by:
                                                   * Role type (backend SWE, data science, finance, etc.)

                                                   * Interview round (technical, behavioral, case)

                                                   * Signal strength indicators (what “good” actually looks like)

This is the equivalent of Harvey’s internal legal reasoning scaffolding — not the model itself.
C) Question archetype bank
 A tagged, curated dataset of:
                                                      * Common interview question patterns

                                                      * Mapped to skills, gaps, and round type

                                                      * Retrieved based on the user’s specific deficiencies

This ensures questions feel eerily relevant, not generic.

Where the vector database actually fits
A vector database is useful when you need semantic retrieval across:
                                                         * Rubric text
                                                         * Question archetypes
                                                         * Role expectations
                                                         * Company-specific interview styles (later)
For InterviewProof:
                                                         * The vector DB stores embeddings of rubric chunks, question templates, and role expectations

                                                         * At runtime, you retrieve the top-k most relevant chunks based on:

                                                            * Resume evidence
                                                            * Job description requirements
                                                            * Interview round
This allows the LLM to reason with only high-signal context, reducing hallucination and cost.

This is what transforms the app from “AI advice” into a diagnostic system.

                                                                                                                  * The model is not the product

                                                                                                                  * The domain logic is

                                                                                                                  * Outputs are trusted because they’re grounded

InterviewProof mirrors that pattern:
                                                                                                                     * LLM = analyst

                                                                                                                     * Vector DB = memory

                                                                                                                     * Rubrics + scoring = authority

                                                                                                                     * Verdict = product

That’s a vertical AI tool — not because of the tech buzzwords, but because the system owns the judgment.

4) How to entice people to pay (and not just use freemium)
Freemium fails when the free output feels “complete.” It wins when free creates clarity + anxiety, and paid provides resolution + action.
The most effective paywall pattern for your product
Give away:
                                                                                                                        * the score

                                                                                                                        * the top 3 rejection risks (teaser)

Lock behind pay:
                                                                                                                           * the full ranked risk list (10–15 items)

                                                                                                                           * the “why” evidence mapping (“where your resume shows / doesn’t show this”)

                                                                                                                           * role-specific questions (the part people feel is customized)

                                                                                                                           * downloadable report

                                                                                                                           * rerun / delta tracking

This mirrors what works in other tools:
                                                                                                                              * Rezi gates depth and “score/keyword targeting” features behind paid tiers while allowing basic creation free.

Add 3 “conversion triggers” that reliably increase paid rate
                                                                                                                                 1. Urgency window

                                                                                                                                    * “Your interview is soon → unlock the 2-hour prep plan + top 10 questions”

                                                                                                                                       2. Proof artifact

                                                                                                                                          * PDF report people can send to mentors/friends (shareability increases perceived value)

                                                                                                                                             3. Guarantee

                                                                                                                                                * 7-day money-back guarantee reduces hesitation (common in these markets; Big Interview uses a 30-day guarantee framing).

Be careful with “undetectable live copilot”
Some competitors market “stealth / undetectable” interview copilots.
That can sell, but it’s also ethically messy and can violate interview rules. If you want InterviewProof to be a serious “Harvey-like” trusted tool, position it as prep + readiness, not cheating.

                                                                                                                                                      * top 3 risks free

                                                                                                                                                      * full diagnostic paid

                                                                                                                                                      * rerun + delta score paid

Architecture (fast + defensible)
                                                                                                                                                         * Frontend: Next.js (upload + results + “history timeline”)

                                                                                                                                                         * Backend: Node or Python (either is fine)

                                                                                                                                                         * LLM: one structured JSON analysis prompt

                                                                                                                                                         * Rules engine: deterministic scoring on top of JSON

                                                                                                                                                         * Storage: optional but recommended (store runs + deltas)

Minimal scoring rubric (enough to be believable)
Example weights (you can tune later):
                                                                                                                                                            * Hard requirement match: 35%

                                                                                                                                                            * Evidence depth (metrics, ownership, recency): 25%

                                                                                                                                                            * Round readiness (technical vs behavioral vs case): 20%

                                                                                                                                                            * Resume clarity/communication: 10%

Key: show evidence for each penalty.

6) What to call the score (important for trust)
Avoid “pass probability.” You can’t validate that in MVP and you’ll lose credibility.
Use:
                                                                                                                                                               * Readiness Score

                                                                                                                                                               * Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)

                                                                                                                                                               * Top rejection risks (ranked)

That’s still psychologically powerful, without pretending you can predict outcomes.

7) Competitive positioning in one sentence
                                                                                                                                                                  * ResuMax/Rezi: “Get interviews” (resume optimization)

                                                                                                                                                                  * Exponent/Big Interview: “Practice a lot” (courses + mocks)

                                                                                                                                                                  * Interviewing.io: “Pay for expert mocks” (premium coaching)

8) Recommended monetization for you (final answer)
If you want $15 premium and strong conversion:
Do this:
                                                                                                                                                                     * Free: score + top 3 risks

                                                                                                                                                                     * $15: full report + PDF + rerun once

                                                                                                                                                                     * $29: 3 reports bundle

                                                                                                                                                                     * $49: unlimited reruns for 14 days

This aligns with user behavior (multiple interviews, multiple rounds) and matches what the market already accepts in adjacent tools.
