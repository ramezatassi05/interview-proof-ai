# NewFeatures-InterviewProof-PostMVP.md

## Vision Shift: From Dashboard → Career Intelligence Engine

InterviewProof should no longer feel like a scoring dashboard.

It should feel like:
> A private career intelligence report forecasting your interview trajectory.

The goal of Post-MVP is to:
- Increase perceived intelligence
- Increase perceived depth
- Increase economic gravity (credits system)
- Increase student trust
- Increase actionable clarity

# 1️⃣ STRUCTURAL UI UPGRADES

## Problem
Current layout feels horizontally empty and vertically light.  
It looks clean but not powerful.

## Solution: Three-Layer Layout Architecture

### LEFT SIDEBAR (Persistent Navigation)
- Dashboard
- Diagnostics
- Risk Simulation
- Study Intelligence
- Progress History
- Credits Wallet

Purpose:
- Increase product depth perception
- Encourage feature discovery
- Add seriousness

---

### CENTER PANEL (Primary Intelligence Report)
Core report remains here:
- Executive Summary
- Scores
- Key Insights
- Risks
- Study Plan

---

### RIGHT STICKY INTELLIGENCE PANEL (Context-Aware)

This panel dynamically updates based on the tab the user is viewing.

#### When Viewing: Score Breakdown
Show:
- Percentile vs other candidates
- Trend vs last diagnostic
- Time-to-80% readiness estimate
- Top 2 moves to increase pass probability

#### When Viewing: Risks
Show:
- Recruiter Reaction Probability
- Resume Signal Strength Indicator
- Industry Benchmark Comparison
- Immediate Resume Rewrite Suggestions

#### When Viewing: Study Plan
Show:
- Time-to-Target Projection
- Skill Dependency Tree (mini visual)
- If completed → projected pass probability

This fills visual space while increasing perceived intelligence.

# 2️⃣ DIAGNOSTIC REPORT ENHANCEMENTS

## 2.1 Interview Archetype Profile

Classify student as:

- Technical Potential, Low Polish
- Strong Theoretical, Weak Execution
- Resume-Strong, System-Weak
- Balanced but Unproven
- High Ceiling, Low Volume Practice

Why:
Students love identity signals. It increases memorability and shareability.

---

## 2.2 Interview Round Forecast

Break down pass probability by round:

- Online Assessment: 72%
- Technical Round 1: 61%
- System Design: 38%
- Behavioral: 54%

This makes the product feel predictive.

---

## 2.3 Cognitive Risk Map (Spider Chart)

Dimensions:
- Algorithm Speed
- Concept Recall
- Communication Clarity
- Depth vs Breadth
- Resume Signal Strength

Purpose:
Visual complexity = perceived depth.

---

## 2.4 Career Trajectory Projection

Add forecasting layer:

"If no additional prep: pass probability declines due to competition velocity."

"If study plan completed in 6 weeks: projected improvement +18%."

This moves from scoring → modeling.

---

## 2.5 Recruiter Red Flag Simulation

Rename "Risks" to:
> Recruiter Red Flags

Each includes:
- Likelihood recruiter notices
- Severity impact
- Suggested fix
- Resume rewrite suggestion

---

# 3️⃣ PRODUCT-LEVEL FEATURES (Diagnostic Focused)

InterviewProof remains a diagnostic intelligence layer — not a prep platform.

---

## 3.1 Practice Sync Intelligence

User inputs:
- LeetCode stats
- Pramp mock count
- Interview attempts
- Coding speed

System outputs:
- Weak topic clusters
- Practice efficiency score
- Interview fatigue risk
- Undertrained concept areas

You become the meta-analysis engine.

---

## 3.2 Precision Practice Prescriptions

Instead of vague advice:

Bad:
"Practice more C++."

Good:
"Complete 14 medium DP problems under 25 mins."
"Run 3 verbal-first mock sessions focusing on tradeoff explanations."

Make it surgical.

---

## 3.3 Pressure Handling Index

Ask:
- Do you narrate while coding?
- Average time to first solution?
- How often stuck >5 mins?
- Edge case confidence?

Output:
> Pressure Handling Index (0–100)

No one else quantifies this.

---

## 3.4 Consistency & Momentum Score

Track:
- Plan completion %
- Improvement delta between reports
- Days active
- Re-analysis trends

Creates seriousness without gamification fluff.

---

# 4️⃣ CREDITS SYSTEM (ProofCredits)

## Naming

- ProofCredits
- Career Capital
- Readiness Credits
- Signal Tokens

Recommended: **ProofCredits**

---

## Wallet UI

Top bar display:
💰 120 ProofCredits

Hover tooltip:
- 1 Full Diagnostic = 25 credits
- Risk Simulation = 10 credits
- Resume Deep Rewrite = 15 credits

---

## Credit Spending Options

Users spend credits for:
- Full Diagnostic
- Deep Risk Simulation
- Resume Signal Rewrite
- Market Benchmark Report
- Behavioral Simulation Analysis
- Trajectory Forecast Report

---

## Scarcity & Earning Mechanics

Earn credits by:
- Uploading new resume version
- Completing study plan tasks
- Improving readiness score
- Referring friends
- Weekly login streak

Credits feel like strategic capital for career upgrades.

---

# 5️⃣ LANGUAGE & POSITIONING UPGRADE

Replace weak terminology:

Score Breakdown → Signal Strength Analysis  
Risks → Recruiter Red Flags  
Technical Interview Analysis → Readiness Intelligence Report  
Study Plan → Execution Roadmap  
Pass Probability → Interview Conversion Likelihood  

Words increase perceived seriousness.

---

# 6️⃣ PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

If limited time, implement in this order:

1. Percentile comparison vs other candidates
2. Interview Archetype Profile
3. Interview Round Forecast
4. Trajectory Projection
5. Credits Wallet System
6. Context-Aware Intelligence Panel
7. Pressure Handling Index

---

# 7️⃣ END STATE GOAL

InterviewProof should feel like:

- A quantified career assessment
- A predictive modeling tool
- A strategic decision engine
- A serious intelligence layer

Not just a score dashboard.
